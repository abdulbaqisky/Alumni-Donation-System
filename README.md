# Alumni-Donation-System
The purpose of this project is to develop a Web-based application which allows graduating students or alumni members to share or give out their unneeded items to the undergraduate students who may need them. These items include may include mattress, refrigerator, books, kitchen utensils etc. Your application should have a dashboard for the alumni members or graduating students that allows the them to upload items on the platform for donation which can be viewed by all registered students. The application should also have a dashboard for the students to view all items that are available for donations and make requests for only those ones that are needed. Alumni members should be able to see all the requests made for each unique donation and grant an approval to only one request. Only one student can receive a particular donation at a time
